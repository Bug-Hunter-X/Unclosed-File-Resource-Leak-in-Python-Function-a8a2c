This repository demonstrates a common Python bug: an unclosed file resource due to improper exception handling. The 'bug.py' file showcases the flawed code where a file might remain open after encountering errors during file processing. The solution, presented in 'bugSolution.py', illustrates how to reliably close the file using a 'finally' block, guaranteeing resource release regardless of exceptions.
